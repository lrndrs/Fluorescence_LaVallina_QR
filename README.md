Abstract:
Speleothem fluorescence can provide insights into past vegetation dynamics and stalagmite chronology. However, its origin and especially the formation of fluorescent laminations in stalagmites are poorly understood. We conducted a year-long monthly monitoring of drip water fluorescence in La Vallina cave (northern Iberian Peninsula) and compared the results to drip water chemistry and active speleothems from the same sites. Drip waters were analyzed using fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), and the resulting five-component model indicates contributions from vegetation, microbial activity, and bedrock. Intra-site fluorescence variability is mainly influenced by changes in overlying vegetation, water reservoir time, and respiration rates. Contrary to prevailing views, we find no systematic increase in drip water fluorescence during rainy conditions across drip sites and seasonal variations in drip water fluorescence are absent at a location where present-day speleothem layers form. Our findings challenge the notion of a higher abundance of humic-like fluorescence during the rainy season as the primary cause for layer formation and suggest additional controls on drip water fluorescence, such as bedrock interaction and microbial reprocessing. We also propose that growth rate may control the dilation of the fluorescence signal in stalagmites, indicating other potential mechanisms for fluorescent layer formation.
